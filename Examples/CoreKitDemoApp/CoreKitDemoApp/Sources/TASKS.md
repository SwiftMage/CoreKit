# Onboarding Feature Implementation

Implement a multi-step onboarding flow for new users.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Define content for individual onboarding steps (`DemoOnboardingSteps.swift`)
- [x] Create container view to manage steps and navigation (`OnboardingContainerView.swift`)

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Integrate `OnboardingContainerView` into the main app flow (e.g., show it conditionally on first launch).

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add state persistence to track if onboarding has been completed.
- [ ] Enhance styling and animations.

## Implementation Plan

1.  Define `OnboardingStep` conforming structs for each screen's content (`DemoStep1`, `DemoStep2`, etc.).
2.  Create an `OnboardingContainerView` that holds an array of these steps.
3.  Use a `TabView` with `PageTabViewStyle` within `OnboardingContainerView` to display the steps.
4.  Implement `@State` to track the current step index.
5.  Add `HStack` with "Previous" and "Next"/"Finish" buttons below the `TabView`.
6.  Bind button actions to update the current step index or call an `onFinish` callback.
7.  Conditionally present `OnboardingContainerView` when the app launches, likely based on a value in `UserDefaults` or a dedicated state management system.
